- adjust directory structure to a more standard (non-GWT and non-webapp) layout, eg. 
  package ...gwt.client.rpc --> ...model 
  ./base_war/WEB_INF/lib/ --> ./lib/
  See ChangeLog 2010-08-20
  
- replace direct access to the aquaportal REST service with corresponding (to-be-developed) 
  operations against the Ont service.
  
- Mavenize (but look at Buildr as well, perhaps getting the best from both).

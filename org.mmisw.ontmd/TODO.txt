org.mmisw.ontmd Ontology Metadata Manager
Carlos Rueda - MMI / MBARI

(p: Paul;  j: John)

p: I can submit the same ontology twice and it doesn't detect or offer the opportunity to 
create a new version. Will we eventually use a process as we discussed yesterday? 
IE Step 1 => new or update, Step 2 => check metadata, Step 3 => check with backend for errors.
 

j: What is relationship of: (a) Original source -> URI of original ontology (b)
Original URI (upper left of metadata tab),, (c) General -> Link to original
ontology, (d) the unnamed xmlns (e) the xml:base

j: The ontology in Ontology tab should be clearly identified as the original
ontology. Then there should be a window (maybe under that one?) that shows the
uploaded ontology. So the two can be inspected together.


p: The Show view with the iframe is clocking in at 1.5MB per load. The front-end
already runs about 500KB, and ontmd looks like it's ~1000KB. It's kind of slow
for me on my connection from home. Takes ~15 secs to load the whole view.

p: Could the Review pop-up window have an upload button if the review passes?

p: It looks like the boxes are missing the outsides on Firefox.




j: We'll need an undo for that (Example, Reset)  someday. Not now.

org.mmisw.ontmd Ontology Metadata Manager
Carlos Rueda - MMI / MBARI


* from Paul:
- It's unclear how to submit a new version of an existing ontology. It didn't seem
 to detect when I submitted the device ontology again (not sure how it would - URI I'm guessing). 

- I can submit the same ontology twice and it doesn't detect or offer the opportunity to 
create a new version. Will we eventually use a process as we discussed yesterday? 
IE Step 1 => new or update, Step 2 => check metadata, Step 3 => check with backend for errors.

- The Show view with the iframe is clocking in at 1.5MB per load. The front-end
already runs about 500KB, and ontmd looks like it's ~1000KB. It's kind of slow
for me on my connection from home. Takes ~15 secs to load the whole view.

- Could the Review pop-up window have an upload button if the review passes?

- Can't hit enter to login after typing username/password

- It looks like the boxes are missing the outsides on Firefox.



* from JG:
- Eventually we'll want the main theme to be a selection from a number of
vocabularies. Not sure if we'll want every term in each vocabulary though, or if
we'll want the name to match the vocabulary's term. Probably "all of the above",
knowing how these things work. For now, we just need to populate this from an
easily edited table that has 'menu selection', 'term name', 'uri', and
'description'. The third and fourth make up the tool tip for each selection. The
URI goes into the URI field, and the menu selection and description go into the
drop down). Or something along those lines.

- Roll-over tips on fields are a little confusing; hot-links or icons will be better

- default the timestamp component to just YYYYMMDD? otherwise too long (add the 
other when YYYYMMDD isn't sufficient) version can be the longer name if you want

- is the shortName in the URI always the same as the Topic?  this will be confusing, 
many ontologies are named very differently than their nominal topic (say OntoSensor.owl,
 for example)
 
- What is relationship of: (a) Original source -> URI of original ontology (b)
Original URI (upper left of metadata tab),, (c) General -> Link to original
ontology, (d) the unnamed xmlns (e) the xml:base

- The ontology in Ontology tab should be clearly identified as the original
ontology. Then there should be a window (maybe under that one?) that shows the
uploaded ontology. So the two can be inspected together.

- We'll need an undo for that (Example, Reset)  someday. Not now.

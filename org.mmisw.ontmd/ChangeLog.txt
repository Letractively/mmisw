2009-11-30   1.7.0.alpha
	- Setting version to 1.7.0.alpha reflecting all the 1.6.1+ changes below.
	  This is also sync'ed with iserver module.
	- Current Ont version: MMI Ontology and Term URI Resolver. Version 1.4.2.beta (20091125194637)
	
	Issue 146: metadata panel: improve display including clickable URL when possible
	- Now with clickable links. See Util.isUrl(String str) and call in MetadataGroupPanel.ViewOnlyCell
	  This only applies when the whole attribute value matches a URL regex.
	  TODO: detect and make clickable links for URLs embedded in a single value. Because of
	  GWT limitations in the emulation of the JRE library, this may require help from the server side. 
	  
	
2009-11-24   1.6.2.alpha7
	Issue 146: metadata panel: improve display including clickable URL when possible
	- some improvement in display of metadata in view-only mode: not using
	  a textbox but HTML. This is also preparation to include clickable links.
	  
	- direct visit to ...#voc2rdf and ...#vine didn't properly check that the user
	  may be already logged in. Now it goes to the tool immediately if the user is logged in.
	  
	  
2009-11-24   1.6.2.alpha6
	- User account creation improved. Upon creation, the interface goes to the
	  update mode of the panel.
	Fixed Issue 226: Phone field is required
	- It's optional now.


2009-11-24   1.6.2.alpha5
	Issue #222 - duplicate of issue #43: Handle non-UTF8 and UTF8 inputs
	- Changes completed in iserver module.
	- Detection of non-UTF-8 tested with {iserver}/resource/theme-windows-1250.owl
	- In general, the handling of UTF-8 should be complete now.

2009-11-18   1.6.2.alpha5
	issue #139: Can't select AGU as authority abbreviation
	- FieldWithChoose: make sure no item is selected so we get an change event on the 
	  first item (needed for firefox at least).
	
2009-11-17   1.6.2.alpha5
	Issue #222 - duplicate of issue #43: Handle non-UTF8 and UTF8 inputs
	As part of this revision, I did this adjustment:
	- UploadServlet: uploaded file should be handled as binary, so now a
	   FileOutputStream is used to capture the contents instead of a FileWriter.
	   
	- RegisterNewPage1: nextButton.setEnabled(false) if there is error loading the file.
	   
	   

2009-11-13   1.6.2.alpha4
	Issue #221 retain the original camelCase in the URLs
	fixed (see iserver module)
		
	
2009-11-11   1.6.2.alpha3
	Issue 212: remove "only index" option for registering external ontology
	- Done. RegisterNewPage2
	
2009-11-10   1.6.2.alpha3

	Issue 207: Remember me on this computer
	- Implemented.  See LoginPanel, new CookieMan and references.
	 
	Issue 209: list of ontologies ordered by time of registration; most recent first
	- Done, see OntologyTable: sortColumn, sortFactor.
	
	Issue 208: "return to ontology browser" instead of "close"
	- Done. Added MyDialog.setCloseButtonText(String text) and called in appropriate places. 
	
	Issue 211: Remove unnecesary registration confirmation dialogs
	- Done in RegisterNewExecute and RegisterVersionExecute
	
	Other:
		- the "details" button (that shows the initial evaluation of the metadata of an uloaded file)
		is now *only* included if the user is an administrator or the code is running not as Script.	
	
	
2009-11-10   1.6.2.alpha2
	Issue #214: "Direct registration of ontology"
	- see iserver: using new service IServer.registerOntologyDirectly.
	  This now dispatches a "graphId" parameter intended to indicate the desired model
	  graph at the "Ont" service back-end. At time of writing such service is not yet implemented
	  in the "Ont" module.
	  

2009-11-09   1.6.2.alpha
	Issue #214: "Direct registration of ontology" 
	- First version implemented
	- this version only processes hosting type "re-hosted"
	
	- updated UploadServlet to allow extension
	- new server/DirectRegistrationServlet extends UploadServlet
	- new public/direg.html -- form for demonstrating the functionality
	- updated Main.gwt.xml, web.xml
	
	DirectRegistrationServlet extends UploadServlet to inherit the basic upload
	functionality. Overwrites processItems to process the rest of the registration process.
	
	Information for the client:
	--------------------------	
	The fields in the POST request must indicate:
		- username/password: MMI ORR user submitting the ontology
		- ontologyUri:  URI associated with the submitted ontology
		- file:  the selected file in the local system
	
	Note:
		1) the client should indicate the ontology URI (ie., this is not
			obtained automatically from the contents of the ontology)
		2) if the ontology URI is already registered, then the submitting user must be
			the same.
			
	

2009-11-04   1.6.1.alpha
	Implemented #203: Allow to upload file for new version instead of in-place editing
	- PortalMainPanel.editNewVersion: now a confirmation dialog is shown so the user can
	  decide whether s/he wants in-place editing of the contents of the ontology (and the metadata
	  as well), OR upload a file for the new version. The message is:
	  
		Do you want to do in-place editing of the contents of the ontology?
		Click OK to proceed with in-place editing of the contents and the metadata.
		Click Cancel to proceed with file upload and metadata editing (file upload is optional).
		
	Fixed #186: "progress info remains open after task in completed"
	- StatusPopup: now has an internal timer to auto-hide the popup every few seconds. The popup will
	  show up again upon any update to the status. See StatusPopup for more details.
	  
	Fixed #194: "Can't access all ontologies from VINE drop-down"
	- OntologySelection.addVocabulary: added a ListBox which the user can also use to select the
	  ontology.


2009-11-03   1.6.0.alpha
	- Setting version to 1.6.0.alpha reflecting all the 1.5.0.alpha30 changes below.
	  This is also sync'ed with iserver module.
	
	- Note that Omv.acronym is now a required attribute (see iserver module), in particular
	  because it is used *also* as the shortName component in the voc2rdf and vine interfaces.
	- Enhancement #202: "Upload button (in new portal) is ambiguous"
		Name of the button is now "Upload ontology"
	- Improved the tooltips for the three buttons:
		Create vocabulary
			Allows to create an ontology from a tabular arrangement of terms using the integrated Voc2RDF tool
		Create mapping
			Allows to create a mapping ontology using the integrated VINE tool
		Upload ontology
			Allows to prepare and register an external ontology file 
	- MetadataGroupPanel.putValues: special cases: acronym and authority abbreviation: 
		Do not allow '/', '\', or ':' (in particular '/') to avoid having an incorrect MmiUri.
	- HeaderPanel: added link to Terms of Use: http://marinemetadata.org/orr/tou
	  

	misc changes:	  
	- Renamed ontmd.launch to orr.launch
	  
	
2009-10-20   1.5.0.alpha30
	- RegisterVersionWizard sequence complete for both FULLY_HOSTED and RE_HOSTED hosting types:
  		- page 0: user indicates whether a file will be uploaded as basis for new version. If so,
  		  goes to page 1; otherwise to the metadata pages.
		- page 1: the upload file page. In RE_HOSTED mode, checks that the URI is equal to the
		  registered one.
		- page 2: options for initializing the metadata fields in the subsequence pages
		  according to values in the two sources (uploaded file and the registered ontology):
			o Use values from both sources with new values overwriting registered values, if any
			o Use values from both sources with registered values overwriting new values, if any
			o Use only values from the loaded ontology
			o Use only values from the registered ontology
		  Includes a "details" button to show the values from the two sources.
			
		- next pages to edit metadata
		- Finish with a call to RegisterVersionExecute.reviewAndRegisterVersionOntology
		
		Various test OK.
		

2009-10-19   1.5.0.alpha30
	- package extont: made various file renamings in preparation for wizard sequence to 
	  register a *new version* of a registered ontology.
	- Now, the "Upload" button dispatches the #rx tag
	
	- PortalMainPanel.editNewVersion():
		- checks the case of "external ontology" (ie, when the ontologyData is of
		  type OtherOntologyData) to dispatch the new wizard
		  
	- RegisterVersionWizard: new wizard to register a *new version* of an *external ontology*:
	  (yet to be implemented)
  		- page 0: user indicates whether a file will be uploaded as basis for new version
		- page 1: the upload file page. The tool will prompt the user about overwriting or not 
		  metadata values in the new file that are different from the ones in the registered 
		  current version.
		- next pages to edit metadata (these will depend on the type of hosting)
		- confirmation page
	  ==> Continue with
	  		PortalMainPanel.editNewVersion()
			RegisterVersionWizard.finish()
			  
	  
	  
2009-10-16   1.5.0.alpha30
	- more tests, preparing for release.
	
	
2009-10-07   1.5.0.alpha30
	issue #99 Normalize theme/topic/class throughout interface
	issue #177: Re-hosting option is not clear
		First complete tests OK for the following:
			- Sequence for registering a new ontology in fully-hosted mode
			- Sequence for registering a new ontology in re-hosted mode
			
			
2009-10-06   1.5.0.alpha30
	- issue #196 capture omv:reference
		MetadataSection1: This property included here.
		TODO: handle multiple entries in the same field (one per line, presumably)
		
		
		
2009-10-02   1.5.0.alpha30
	- First test of full sequence to register an external ontology in full hosted mode:
	  first basic test working, but details pending including:
	  	- log in first and then run #rx (this will be the case when button "register external ont" be provided) 
	  	- proper handling of user-specified ontology URI (via given authority-shortName);
	  	  the acronym (== resourceType) still used.  Need to clarify this.
	
	
	- Reorganizing code (iserver included) to better capture info about starting ontology (either
	  TempOntologyInfo or RegisteredOntologyInfo.
	- Removing some use of RegisteredOntologyInfo where (the more generic) BaseOntologyInfo is more 
	  appropriate.  TODO there still several places to adjust. 
	  Start from RegisterExternalOntologyWizard.finish(..), which does basically the following:
	  
		  CreateOntologyInfo createOntologyInfo = new CreateOntologyInfo();
		  createOntologyInfo.setBaseOntologyInfo(tempOntologyInfo);
		  // assign authority and shortName given by the user
		  //..
		  and the call:
		  portalMainPanel.createNewFromFile(createOntologyInfo); 
	  The createOntologyInfo parameter here is new; the provided authority/shortName is NOT used yet
	  in the rest of calls. TODO continue from here.
	  NOTE: in particular, the intent is also to separate "shortName" from "resourceType",
	  see Issue #99: "Normalize theme/topic/class throughout interface"
	
	
2009-10-01   1.5.0.alpha30
	Continuing #177: Re-hosting option is not clear
	- Wizard sequence launched with #rx

2009-09-30   1.5.0.alpha30
	- Including org.mmisw.ont.misc.jar (generated by the "ont" module) because of changes in
	  iserver module. In particular, JenaUtil2 is now in package org.mmisw.ont.
	  
	- Several more preparations for #177: Re-hosting option is not clear
	  Wizard is now in new package org.mmisw.ontmd.gwt.client.portal.extont
		Page1: selection and upload of local file into working space
		Page2: selection of hosting option (fully hosted; re-hosted; re-indexed)
		PageFullyHosted: Summary to then proceed with regular ontology metadata editing and registration
		PageReHosted: Summary to then proceed with regular ontology metadata editing and registration
		PageIndexed: "Finish" in this page will complete the submission ("indexing")
	  None of the "Finish" actions in these final pages are implemented yet.
	  


2009-09-29   1.5.0.alpha29
	Fixed issue #192 "wrong versioned/unversioned response"
	Fixed Issue #193 "list of versions include unversioned"
	See iserver module.
	
	
2009-09-28  1.5.0.alpha28
	More preparations for #177: Re-hosting option is not clear
	- RegisterExternalOntologyPageBase and subclasses: these will be wizard-like pages for a new sequence 
	  to upload and register an external ontology. Still preliminary. Call with #rx to launch the sequence.
	  The idea is as follows:
		  Page1: selection and upload of local file into working space
		  Page2: selection of hosting option (fully hosted; re-hosted; re-indexed)
		  Page3: Summary of the effect on the option selected
		  Finish in page3: Continue with the usual ontology metadata editing and final registration
	  
	  
	
2009-09-22  1.5.0.alpha27
	fixed #191 No feedback if javascript is disabled
	- index.html: included <noscript> section with a message:
		The MMI ORR Portal requires JavaScript enabled in your web browser.
		Enable JavaScript and then refresh this page.
	
2009-09-21  1.5.0.alpha27
	- Dispatching .../orr/#voc2rdf and .../orr/#vine
	  For now, these tags "redirect" to the main browse page (.../orr/#b ) where a Window.alert
	  is shown indicating something like:
	  	Please, sign in and then select "<the corresponding button>" to use the integrated <tool name>
	  	
	  This change is mainly intended as a preparation to dispatch direct references to these tools.
	  In particular, I'm updating mmisw.org/{voc2rdf,vine} (which appear in some marinemetadata site
	  pages) to redirect to mmisw.org/orr/#{voc2rdf,vine}.
	  
	  TODO Two possible improvements:
	  	- Immediatly prompt the user for Sign in, and then launch the corresponding tool
		- Dispatch the tool even if the user is not logged in; prompt for sign in when necessary
	  	
	  
	
2009-09-21  1.5.0.alpha26
	- fixed #188: Clarify search options on portal front page
		SearchOntologiesPanel: using TLabel and with "Search ontologies:" label
		OntMdImageBundle: transparent bg for tooltip icon (question12t.gif) for better display
		
	- fixed issue #187 CSV support broken
		VocabClassPanel.SeparatorPanel: fixed handling of selected separator
	
2009-09-16-18  1.5.0.alpha25
	 - implemented #172: search list of ontologies
	 	- New "search ontologies" in the main page to find ontologies according to a given string, which is
	   		searched in basic properties of the ontology.
	 	- "Search" link now called "Search terms" to make clear the distinction
	 	- Tooltips added to bot search options.
	 	
	- Implemented #184: Dispatch term URI in portal
		- The dispatch is now generalized for both ontologies and terms:
			.../orr/#<uri>
	  	  This translates to a call to resolveUri in the iserver module. The return value will determine
	  	  what specific panel and object to dispatch in the GUI.
	 - some reorganization of the interface ("search" link now in the header section)
	 
	
	
		
2009-09-16  1.5.0.alpha24
	- MetadataGroupPanel: #183: Don't ask user whether the submitted ontology is a mapping
	  This should be determined by examining the contents of the ontology.
	  See "listall" operation in Ont module.
	  
	- ResourceTypeWidget(AttrDef attr, boolean editing, boolean includeIsMapCheck, ChangeListener cl):
	  Smaller size of this area so it aligns better with rest of the fields in the form.
	
2009-09-15  1.5.0.alpha23
	- implemented #181: Include ontology URI column in ontology table
		OntologyTable: "URI" column included
	
	- implemented #180: "my submitted ontologies" entry in the tree
		SelectionTree: the first subtree is now, when the user is logged:
			+ All ontologies
				Registered by me
				+ Registered by:
					user1
					user2
					...
		and simply All ontologies when not logged in.
		

2009-09-15  1.5.0.alpha22
	- Removed "portal.service.url" property and associated config methods from everywhere as it is not needed.
	  This change makes it easy to redeploy the generated WAR file (with just a change in the name
	  of the WAR if desired/necessary), without any needed internal changes. 
	  
	- Removed "vine.service.url" property and associated config methods from everywhere as it is not used.
	
	- Main: now, always launches the portal (TODOS lots of code clean-up)
	
	
	  

2009-09-11  1.5.0.alpha21
	- General user account management, login, and password reset completed:
		Fixed issue #176: login issue - forgot password user name
		Fixed Issue #173: user phone number can not be changes
	- See iserver's changelog.
	- Check email address before creating/updating a user account. Ideally, a full verification
	  would include using the email (eg., sending some special URL that the user can click to
	  verify/activate his/her account).
	- Removed LoginListener (not needed anymore-- TODO lots of old code to be removed)
		
	- TODO Next: use cookies to keep the session (Issue #154)




2009-09-10  1.5.0.alpha20

	- various adjustments to dispatch user account creation/update
	- user account creation/update: updates in iserver
	
	
	- Renamed Config to PortalConfig
	- PortalConfig: new properties: MAIL_USER, MAIL_PASSWORD
	- Renamed UserPanel to LoginPanel
	- Removed class Login (now using iserver's service authenticateUser)
	- LoginPanel now with options to: 
		- reset password - working
		- create account - preliminary code
	- {activation,mail}.jar included included to support iserver's MailSender helper.

	
2009-09-09  1.5.0.alpha19
	- Fixed a bug in OntologyPanel related with the mechanism to set shortName and authority.
	  It was using the createOntologyInfo object by calling createOntologyInfo.{getAuthority(),getShortName()},
	  but these attributes have not been assigned from the newValues map!
	  It must be a regression problem.
	  Temporary quick fix: assign 
	  	authority = newValues.get("http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/20081020/ontologyMetadata/origMaintainerCode")
	  	shortName = newValues.get("http://omv.ontoware.org/2005/05/ontology#acronym")
	  TODO: clean up this code! 
	  Note that RegisteredOntologyInfo ontologyInfo is being used here even for a brand new
	  ontology that is just going to be registered (should it be a BaseOntologyInfo?)
	
	
2009-09-08  1.5.0.alpha18
	Fix for issue #174 and general improvement in related functionality.
		See iserver's ChangeLog


2009-09-03  1.5.0.alpha17   (sync'ed with iserver version)
	Fixed issue #168: Submitted ontology not included for SPARQL query processing
	Solved in iserver module; so just updating library and version here.

2009-09-02:  1.5.0.alpha16
	- Fixed issue #171: Repeated mappings are allowed
	  MappingsPanel: new operations:
		- List<Mapping> preAddMappings(Set<String> leftKeys, RelationInfo relInfo, Set<String> rightKeys)
		- void addMappings(RelationInfo relInfo, List<Mapping> mappings)
	  which are called from MapperPage._relButtonClicked(RelationInfo relInfo)
	  
	  TODO preAddMappings: a more efficient implementation to check for duplicates.
	  
	  TODO Re-organize the mappings by grouping according to relation. Instead of list
	  of (left, rel, right) triples, have a list of RelGroup's where a relGroup has a
	  relation and a list of (left, right) pairs. This will consume slightly less memory
	  and will support a more efficient search for duplicates.
	  
	- New behavior: right after the click of the relation button, the selection of terms on both 
	  sides of the interface is cleared (only when any new mapping is actually inserted in the mapping
	  panel). The previous behaviour was that the selections remain.
	  
	  
		
2009-09-01:  1.5.0.alpha15
	- Some code clean-up:
		- PortalMainPanel: removed unused historyTokenMap cache
		- ControlsPanel: removed constant flag useMenuBar=false and related menuBar interface elements
		  as they are not used.
		  
	- Added "Refresh" button to reload the list of registered ontologies.
	
	- Added "Search" functionality.
	  New SearchTermsPanel class. Provides keyword search using the new operation runSparqlQuery(..) in
	  iserver module. Also includes link to SPARQL page.
	  TODO eventually include general SPARQL dispatch here.
		  
		
		
2009-08-28  1.5.0.alpha14
	VINE: 
	- Integration and basic functionality (including creation/registration of new mapping
	  ontology and update/registration of new version of mapping ontology) implemented.
	- Selection (all, none) and removal of selected mappings implemented, so basic editing of mappings included
	- disabled the disclosure panel associated to each mapping (it's not implemented yet).
	
	- SearchGroup: only *individuals* are searched (disabled classes and properties)
	- TODO: for selection of working ontologies (OntologySelection), only include appropriate vocabularies,
	  in particular, do not include other mappings. (check property Omv.usedOntologyEngineeringTool, for example).

	Other changes:
	- Because of new version param in Server.getOntologyContents(RegisteredOntologyInfo registeredOntologyInfo, String version),
	  updated the various call with version==null.
	
	

2009-08-27  1.5.0.alpha14
	VINE: More preparations
	
	 
2009-08-26  1.5.0.alpha14
	Incorporated VINE functionality into this module from the org.mmisw.vine project (which
	will be removed eventually).
	- See ChangeLog in org.mmisw.iserver
	-  Check the retrieval of allOntologies -- the list shows the *versioned* form.

	More updates:  (still incomplete)
	- enabling MappingDataCreationInfo, VineOntologyContentsPanel processing


2009-08-25  1.5.0.alpha13
	issue #148: "Need property to capture "creator/author of original source vocabulary""
	Implemented in iserver and ont modules (just rebuild here with the updated libs)
	
2008-08-24  1.5.0.alpha12
	Fixed issue #161 "New version forces upload of local file"
	- OntologyPanel.reviewAndRegister: using new createOntologyInfo.setPriorOntologyInfo(..) to transfer
	  all necessary info about prior version, now including the actual version.
	- BaseOntologyContentsPanel/OtherOntologyContentsPanel.checkData(boolean isNewVersion): added flag 
	  to indicate if new version.


2008-08-16   1.5.0.alpha11
	- OntologyPanel.reviewAndRegister: Passing "uri" attribute in CreateOntologyInfo object, 
	  which "remembers" previous URI when registering a new version.
	  

2008-08-13  1.5.0.alpha10
  	(only change in iserver library:
		- Issue #164 Keep periods and case in term URI
			- More in general, if the first column given to VocCreator is named "uri," the values
			  are just checked for validity (according to java.net.URI constructor), and now
			  no conversions at all are performed. 
  	)
  	
  	- CreateOntologyInfo and RegisteredOntologyInfo: removed namespaceRoot attribute -- this 
	  was added in a preliminary approach to handle re-hosting. It is not necessary anymore.
	  
	  
	- Fixed Issue #165: "versions" menu included in versions window
	
		  
2009-08-11  1.5.0.alpha9
	Issue #8: Improve HTML response
	As a way to provide complementary ontology browsing capabilities, I links to the 
	Ontology Browser from http://code.google.com/p/ontology-browser/, which I deployed on
	http://mmisw.org/browser (latest version 1.1.6)
	
		- sample.build.properties: new property ontbrowser.service.url
		- If the value is not "-", "Ontology Browser" links will be included in the 
		  controls bar and in the popup menu associated with ontologies to open the ontology using that tool.
		  
	In a future version, we could probably embed the ontology-browser in the ontology panel.
	
	
2009-08-11  1.5.0.alpha8
	- Fixed bug: "version" param always added for requests to the "ont" service
	
	- The latest version is dispached in general; only versioned dispatch in done when an ontology
	  is displayed from the "available versions" window, or if the requested URI is a versioned MmiUri.
	
	- "available versions" window now shows the unversioned URI in the title. The list is now sorted 
	  by descending version (so most recent version first).
  
  

2008-08-10  1.5.0.alpha7   Issue #159: Re-host ontologies: versioning
	- OntologyTable.update(): include version in hyperlinks
	- PortalControl.getDownloadOptionHtml(): include "version" parameter
	
	
	- log4j.xml: assigned same org.mmisw.ontmd's log level to org.mmisw.iserver module.
	
	Various adjustments in UI
		- browse table now with cell padding 3
		- HeaderPanel aligned to the left (so it doesn't get hidden when the contents of the
		  ontology become too wide)
		- "Versions" button re-enabled after fix in iserver (includes all version for each requested 
		  ontology).
	
	
2009-08-05  1.5.0.alpha6
	- Fixed issue #160 Loading an ontology file does not update associated metadata in the editor
		Problem was that the listener registered with the DataPanel was not updated when the mode
		changed from view-only to edit-new-version, so the wrong, obsolete object was notified
		of the load. Now, the listener is retrieved from the PortalControl instance.

2009-08-05  1.5.0.alpha5
	- PortalMainPanel.dispatchMainPanel:  Once a registration was completed, the intended behavior 
	  is to return to the "browse" list. This was not working, but it's now fixed: 
	  History.newItem("browse") is called to synchronize the state with the history.
	  
	- PortalMainPanel & OntologyTable: historyTokenMap is now not actually updated, so the
	  RegisteredOntologyInfo objects are not cached. This simplifies things.
	  TODO: either remove the cache (historyTokenMap) variable or decide how to maintain it.
	
	
1.5.0.alpha4 (change in iserver library)
	- Server.createOntology(CreateOntologyInfo): Do NOT remove "original OWL.Ontology individual"
	  if we are in re-hosting mode (createOntologyResult.isPreserveOriginalBaseNamespace).
	  If we did this on a model with the same original namespace, we would remove the owl:Ontology 
	  entry altogether and get an "rdf:Description" instead.
	  
	  
2009-08-01,03:  1.5.0.alpha3 (was 1.5.0.alpha2)
	- Added build and configuration params to allow deployment of the service on any machine (while
	  removing several related hard-coded pieces, in particular about http://mmisw.org...):
		appserver.host
		ont.service.url
		portal.service.url
		vine.service.url
		bioportal.rest.url
		
		 
2009-07-31  
	1.5.0.alpha2 - including updates in iserver for re-hosting ontologies
	- PortalControl: adjusted link to resolve ontology in rdf and n3.
	
	- Also, preliminary additions to allow the user indicate the namespaceRoot for a newly
	  created vocabulary. New class OntologyUriPanel used in OntologyPanel.
	  This code is disabled in the SVN repository (using flag USE_ONTOLOGY_URI_PANEL).
		

	
2009-07-26
	
	Preparations for re-hosting of external ontology:
		"Re-hosting" means that the original base namespace of the submitted ontology is preserved.
		Basically, the whole ontology is un-changed except for new metadata elements.
	
	- UploadLocalOntologyPanel: new checkbox for preserveOriginalBaseNamespace flag.
	  
	- Basic submission is now handled. I'm testing this with a simple ontology with base namespace
	  http://EXAMPLE.org/abc/example
	  
	- Next: complement other actions:
		- do not capture authority, or, shortName, and the like, associated with MMISW-based namespace
		- "resolve" the ontology for display purposes. This will require adjustments in call to the "ont"
		  service... 


	  
2009-07-24
	- UploadServlet: MAX_FILE_SIZE set to unlimited (-1). See issue #153 "Large ontology file fails to load"
	
	
2009-06-09
	- TermTable2:   (same as TermTable 645 with updates for the following)
		-  Issue 126: "Immediately enter edit mode when I type in a cell"
			Regular key now starts editing mode immediately. Note that the key is appended to
			the current contents of the cell (this contrasts to other systems, eg., google spreadsheet, 
			where this action replaces the contents). 
		
		- issue #127: "Create row automatically"
			While editing last column and row in term table, KEY_ENTER and KET_TAB will add a new 
			row and focus its first cell automatically.
			Note, both KEY_ENTER and KET_TAB accept the text entered (previously, only KEY_ENTER).
	  BUT: the behaviour is not as expected in firefox! :-(  so, still keeping TermTable as was before these changes.
	
	
2009-06-07
	- MenuBarPanel renamed to ControlsPanel; this better reflects the (new) actual contents of that
	  panel, which are buttons and links, but not menus anymore. The buttons and links seem more intuitive.
	
2009-06-06
	Issue #145: "Null response when uploading IOC "
	Issue #43: "Handle non-UTF8 inputs"
	- Included chardet.jar in build, as iserver is now doing verification of UTF-8. 
	  In summary, an error will be reported whenever some external contents, which will be
	  eventually incorporated in the registry, is not in UTF-8.
	  Note: No attempts to make any automated conversion in case the verification fails.
	
	- MetadataPanel: "NewUri" panel removed -not needed anymore  
	- MetadataGroupPanel: show group info only in editing mode
	- UploadLocalOntologyPanel: simplified and better control of buttons (en/disable)
	
	- See also iserver project for other several adjustments
	
	TODO: in general, either have a general mechanism to disable any controls (buttons, menus,..) in
	the whole interface during  the execution of some task, or use a modal dialog. In any case,
	also react to Browser events to properly cancel any task or open menu.
	
 
	
2009-06-05
	- Main: logging buffer allocated only if _log parameter is given (less memory for regular use).
	- UploadLocalOntologyPanel: fixed upload form action location.
	
	- several adjustments as the main operations are completed along with iserver module
	- removed several interim dependencies
	- some renamings of types and operations
	- support for registering an uploaded file completed.  Various tests OK. TODO more tests!
	 

	
	
2009-06-04
	- Including management of uploading of local file in the panel for "other" (not vine/voc2rdf) ontology. 
	- Notification to the metadataPanel included (note: when the user loads a local file
	  for purposes of updating the contents (dataPanel) of the ontology to be submitted, we need
	  to notify the metadataPanel to handle any existing attributes in the uploaded file).
	- Basic functionality of the local file uploading into the working space ready. This includes a 
	  new checking for any possible overwriting of fields already filled in in the metadata panel; the
	  user can decide whether replace or keep the values in the panel. See issue #143
	  
	Next: complete creation of ontology from local file and the associated action when creating
	a new version.
	

2009-06-03
	- Creation of vocabulary completed. Need more testing.
	- Validation of term table re-enabled and improved.
	- Hiding the option to create mapping (not implemented yet)
	- fixed params to properly launch external tool for uploading an ontology from disk
	  Next: include this option within the portal itself. 
	
	
2009-06-02
	- fixed: consider all ontologies when an administrator is logged in.
	- testing ontologies are marked with a T for easy spot
	
	- Versions option implemented: it dispatches an OntologyTable object in a popup dialog.
	  If the user clicks one of the versions, the dialog is closed and the history management
	  takes care of dispatching the requested ontology. We could make the dialog non-modal
	  to keep it visible even as the user navigates the versions, but it would be tricker at
	  this point to control the other possible actions, so safer just to use a modal dialog.
	  
	- QuickInfo menu added for each element in ontology list; this facilitates some actions 
	  (eg viewing prior version, resolving in RDF, N3, etc.) without having to load the complete
	  ontology.
	   

2009-06-01
	- better links section (upper right) including "browse" hyperlink
	- history tokens dispatched: #<ontology-uri>   #browse
	- close window: warning message only shown when in editing mode
	- various other code changes
	- TODO: check filtered out ontologies when administrator is logged in
	
	
2009-05-31
	- Many changes for including editing and creation of new version of a vocabulary ontology
	  TODO: once registered the new version, the browse page is displayed with a reloading of
	  the list of all ontologies. However, the hyperlink for the newly created version does not
	  resolve immediately; it seems the history token is added but the notification does not happen
	  immediately?
	  
	- Filtering out ontologies with authority "mmitest" and "testing"; these are included only when
	  an adminsitrator is logged in.
	  
	- Quick adjustments to the "New" options (Vocabulary, Mapping, Uplaod) to at least launch the 
	  not-yet-integrated mechanisms.
	
	
2009-05-28
	- continuing preparations for editing vocabulary
	- view only vocabulary table now created incrementally (especially useful for large tables, eg., CF)
	- Started implementation of Edit with VocabClassPanel/TermTable. In general, this shows 2 major limitations:
		- slow for big vocabularies
		- fixed column width
	  So, perhaps:
	  	- Disable in-place editing of the table (instead, include a direct import from a local file and process
	  	  the CSV in the back-end for checking, and then update view-only-table for visual feed-back
		- or, allow in-place editing but only for small vocabularies (say with no more than a couple hundred terms);
		  direct the user to the import mechanism above in case of bigger vocabs.		
			
2009-05-27
	- Unifying interface; menuBar set-up depending on interface type; new controller PortalController
	  to improve MVC design.  Better general layout.
	 
	- new EditDataPanel, preparing for editing vocabulary ...
	
2009-05-26
	- DisclosurePanels used for metadata and components in synopsis of ontology
	- ViewTable with column sorting capability
	
2009-05-25
	- Different types of ontology data are now handled, see ViewDataPanel:
		Vocabulary: for each class in the ontology, a table of corresponding datatype properties is shown.
		Mapping: not dispatched yet
		"Other": a synopsis of the classes, properties, and individuals is shown.
	
2009-05-24
	- Per update in iserver module, ontology browse list now shows only the latest versions;
	  each entry contains the prior versions of the ontology, but these are not shown yet.
	  
	  Note that unversioned URIs should be shown in general for the UI in the read-only mode;
	  For editing, it should show versioned URIs.
	   

2009-05-23
	- Moved most of metadata management to iserver ontmd module.
	- Integrated retrieval of metadata and data: operation getOntologyContents
	Basic functionality in place. Note that all contents are retrieved in a single call;
	TODO: implement a paging mechanism.
	
	Next: display data in appropriate format according to "type" of ontology; we basically
	have the following cases: vocabulary (a la voc2rdf), mapping (a la vine), and the others.
	I'm planning on using the omv:usedOntologyEngineeringTool property to explicitly
	assign it to ontologies created by voc2rdf and vine (I just created the related resources
	in the Omv and OmvMmi vocabularies (see ont module).
	
	
2009-05-22
	- Author subtree now includes all usernames (if user is logged)
	
	- DataPanel now using the iserver-based getEntities operation
	
	
2009-05-18
	- OntMdServiceImpl: fixed a recently introduced bug in getOntologyInfoFromRegistry:
		prepareOntologyInfo was not called in the "new mechanism"
		
	- Login: Capture role when user logs in.
	
	- OntologyUploader: if user logged in is an administrator, a special handling is done to
	  allow the submission of an ontology (either brand new, or new version) to be associated
	  to another userId. 
	
2009-05-13
	- Moved types from ...client related with the proper metadata editor to new package ...client.metadata:
		MainPanel
		MetadataGroupPanel
		MetadataPanel
		OntologyPanel
		ResourceTypeWidget
		
	- Removed unused types:
		voc2rdf.rpc.Voc2RdfService
		voc2rdf.rpc.Voc2RdfServiceAsync
		
	- Preparing portal dispatch:
		I created a new module org.mmisw.iserver, which I'm starting to use here to support
		the portal interface and eventually other operations as the refactoring progresses.
		See sibling project org.mmisw.iserver.
	
	
2009-05-11
	- Preparations to show ontology data in view only mode.
		Initially, to show term table for a voc2rdf ontology (based on the associated CSV)
		
	- View only of an ontology now does requests to "Ont" to get the model (via Jena) and the
	  contents of the CSV (if any) via a new Ont operation with (parameter "_csv").
	  TODO remove the "_lpath" operation in "Ont"
	
	
2009-05-07
	- implemented issue #135: preserve URIS from simple vocabularies that allready have defines URIs
	  It works as follows:
	  	- Enabled when the header label for the first column is "URI" (ignoring case) (so, no extra
	  	  check box or other GUI component for the moment)
	  	- Converter: uses a flag keyIsUri which is set to true in createDatatypeProperty if the label
	  	  of the first column is "URI"; then createIndividual uses the flag to determine the
	  	  URI for the individual to be created.
	
2009-05-06
	- fixed issue #131: use abbreviation of organization instead of authority in the web form
	
	- fixed issue 132: add (optional) on the "uri of class" label
		But, instead of adding "optional" to the label, now the "name" field is marked with the
		red star, indicating that the name of the class is required, while the label
		for the URI of the class remains as it is. To complement, a preamble in the interface
		says that "fields marked * are required" (which used to be there in a previous version, btw).
		
	- fixed issue #129:  "Convert to RDF" button below term table
	
2009-04-20
	- Config: a useDefault flag now allows to use pre-defined parameters so I can quickly
		run ontmd and voc2rdf from within eclipse. I will configure this much better, probably
		when I start using GWT 1.6.  Also renamed Main.launch to ontmd.launch and
		created voc2rdf.launch
	
	- preliminary stuff to alert the user when closing the window page.
	
	- Converter: save copy of CSV file.
	- OntMdServiceImpl.upload: upon sucessfull upload, it renames the associated CSV (if any)
	  to a name based on the final ontology URI.  This provides a convenient mechanism to use
	  the CSV version for display purposes.
	

2009-04-16
	- Issue #118: "Difficult to fix errors reported by voc2rdf"
		As an additional improvement, now the affected cell is focused automatically.
		
	- Various GUI improvements to voc2rdf, including an icon for the popup menu associated
	  with the control columns and rows (previously those menus were not apparent). 
	  Also, simple conversion panel layout and new "download" button instead of embedding the
	  resulting RDF contents in the window. This provides: 1) simpler interface (issue #75), 
	  and 2) less memory consumption on the client.
	  
	- Incremental import so the GUI is responsive when importing big files.
		
2009-04-14
	Issue #124: Keep colons in values
		- Now colons are ONLY kept (not replaced with underscores) for the *term IDs* in voc2rdf;
		  so the name for a term (first column), eg., "abc:def:myterm" will result in
		  a term URI like the following http://mmisw.org/ont/someAuth/someVocab/abc:def:myterm
		- See Converter.createIndividual()
		- NOTE: Colons in the name of the class and in the column headers (which are converted to
		  datatype properties in the ontology) are still converted to underscores.
		   
	
2009-04-11, 13  (1.2.0.beta3)
	Issue #116: editing interface in the table is not functional
		- various changes including textbox in each field and navigation with keyboard
		- enter key enables cell for editing; enter typed again returns to navigation
		- first column and first row are made visible if the current focused cell is close
		  enough.
	Note: Some other improvements are of course possible; but any more sophisticated 
	      spreadsheet-like interface would require some significant effort. 
	      
	Fixed issue #115: "Allow tab delimiter when importing data in voc2rdf"
		Now, two buttons are included, both with options to select the desired separator: 
			- "Import" allows to enter terms from a CSV formatted text: the user specifies what
			  character should be interpreted as the field separator
			- "Export" displays the current table in CSV format (for the user to copy-n-paste somewhere);
			  the user indicates the desired separator character.
		- the following separators are possible: comma (,), sem-colon (;), tab, and pipe (|)
		
	Fixed #118: "Difficult to fix errors reported by voc2rdf"
		 Yes, this is difficult in the popup itself.
		 Fix: just let the table be updated; then the user can continue editing; the system
		 will make the error checking when attempting the "Convert to RDF action", anyway.
	
		
2009-04-07
	Implemented issue #84: "allow user-given namespace (URI) in voc2rdf"
	VocabPanel.OntologyUriPanel handles the information about the resulting URI for the ontology.
	The user can now specify the complete URI and later, if desired, revert to the automated 
	handling.

2009-04-07
	Fixed issue #120: "title doesn't get carried forward"
	Problem was that Omv.name was assigned BOTH the class name and the fulltitle.
	Only the fullTitle is now assigned.
	
2009-04-06
	Fixed issue #119: "Allow empty fields in non-required columns"
	This also required to generate "" column values for the missing fields so the original
	voc2rdf scheme to make the conversion (which is based on the com.infomata.data library)
	works with no ArrayOutOfBoundsException's. 
	
2009-04-01
	- setReadOnly(!enabled) instead of setEnabled(enabled) for text fields; this allows the
	  user to select the text even if it's not editable.

2009-03-31    voc2rdf 1.2.0.beta2
	- oops, I introduced a bug with my latest changes: individuales were not put in the
	  namespace appropriately (I forgot to use the namespace (_ns) in Converter.createIndividual()
	  after the change in getGoodName(), which now does not include the namespace itself)
	  -> fixed.
	  
	
2009-03-28,29:   voc2rdf 1.2.0.beta1

	- Many updates to Voc2RDF
		- More metadata captured (title, creator, description, authority)
		- Button convert to RDF now opens a dialog (No tab for conversion)
		- class & terms now in a tab (in preparation for multiple classes)
				
		- New editable, spreadsheet-like table for the terms:
			- The editable table is now the main interface for capturing the terms
			- A new CSV button displays the current table in CSV format; the user
			  can use the text area to update the contents and re-import into the table.

		
2009-03-21
	Issue 99: "Normalize theme/topic/class throughout interface"
	http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=99
	
	Renamings before actual change to the function of the code:
	- "shortName" is actually "resourceType: The current "shortName"-based names in the
	  code actually refer to the "resourceType" concept. (But note that OmvMmi.shortNameUri
	  refers to the URI of the resource type (captured in Omv.acronym).)
	- "mainClass" also refers to "resourceType"
	So the renamings were applied in these places:
		  	BaseInfo: shortNameUri -> resourceTypeUri
		  	MetadataGroupPanel: shortName* -> resourceType*
		  	MdHelper: mainClassAttrDef -> resourceTypeAttrDef 
		  	Voc2RdfBaseInfo: mainClass -> resourceTypeAttrDef
		  	
	Some refactoring and some minor adjustments:
	- new ResourceTypeWidget to handle the resource type set of fields
	- FieldWithChoose as a class in a separate file
	- TLabel: now, internal click does NOT close the tooltip dialog

	NOTE: Implemented my 3/21/09 proposal in issue #99: basically that the resourceType elements
	are used to provide for the "Class" related fields. I assign the labels and 
	tooltips accordingly. Also, there is a single field for the ontologyUri.
	This class related info is captured in the ontology metadata with thre Omv.acronym and
	OmvMmi.shortNameUri, as it is currently done in OntMd, so OntMd will detect those in the
	subsequent submission.
	

		  	
	- Next:
	  - OntMd's review operation uses shortName to do some checks; this refers to the actual shortName 
	  concept BUT it's using the value of Omv.acronym (ie., resourceType); so, continue with adding
	  the field for short name..
	
	
2009-03-20
	- some documentation updates.
	- More code clean-up: deprecating Voc2RdfService* types; the voc2rdf operations are now
	  provided through the ontmd service as well.
	

2009-03-19
	- Completed fix of issue #45: "include URIs for Topic in the ontmd Topic URI -- 
	  Review operation was removing the topic URI field value.
	  1.0.8.beta (20090319092940)
	  
	- Fixed Issue 109: "second review not asked after further changes"
	  Merged the "Review" and "Upload" actions into a single "Review and Upload" button. 
	  Complementary to this, the dialog for the successful review result now includes a button "Upload".
	  The user can either proceed with the upload operation or close the review dialog and continue 
	  editing the metadata.
	  
	  
	- Now, dynamic load of supporting vocabularies to drive drop-down menus. This way, the lists
	  are always displayed with the most recent contents. Previously, these lists were only
	  prepared at deployment time!
	  Also, the options are sorted by name (ignoring case).
	  Also, add sugestedBox to faciliate selection of option from the listBox.
	  1.0.9.beta (20090319164948)
	  
	 
2009-03-18
	- Issue #45: "include URIs for Topic in the ontmd Topic URI field"  -- 1.0.8.beta (20090318234714)
	  See OndMdServiceImpl, MetadataGroupPanel, Option, MdUtil, MdHelper.
	  - OmvMmi.shortNameUri is now associated with Omv.acronym 
	  - OndMdServiceImpl.prepareOntologyInfo(File file, OntologyInfo ontologyInfo): 
	  	if OmvMmi.shortNameUri is part of the list of attributes, then it also assigns OmvMmi.shortNameUri
	  - MetadataGroupPanel: various adjustments.
	    
	- New version.properties as the single point to define the version for this application
	  (both the back-end services and the front-ends). build.xml translates this to the 
	  application via the web.xml (which is read by Config). Also, a "build number", which 
	  is a timestamp, is used for the full version. An AppInfo object is used to share the
	  application info (version) between server and client. 
	  
	- Now, build.properties include many of the (previously) hard-coded parameters. build.xml 
	  updates the web.xml accordingly and then Config makes the params available to the code. 
	  

2009-03-17
	- Using Voc2RDF, I just created and submitted the following vocabularies (with the
	  current values in the authorities.csv and resourcetypes.csv, respectively):
	       http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/20090317T183911/authority
	       http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/20090317T173755/resourcetype
	  A next step is to use these ontologies (instead of the CSV files) to drive the 
	  corresponding drop-down menus.
	  
	  
	- Fixed the ``,,'' issue in voc2rdf: issue #87	
	
	-  Code clean-up:
		- Moved MdHelper from org.mmisw.ont.util/ to org.mmisw.ontmd.gwt.server/
		- New class org.mmisw.ontmd.gwt.server/MdUtil with utilities for MdHelper.
		- Removed org.mmisw.ont.{Omv,OmvMmi} from this project; now, the ont generated
		  library org.mmisw.ont.vocabulary.jar is used instead.
		  
		  
	- Issue #106: "Use ontologies to drive drop-down menus"
	  Started changes to implement this. See Config, MdHelper and MdUtil.
	  Note that Config defines the URI of the class of the vocabulary to be loaded. However,
	  TODO perhaps in a future version multiple classes could be supported in the
	  ontology, so this scheme would have to change.     (1.0.4.beta (20090317))
	  
	  
	- Partially fixed Issue #45: "include URIs for Topic in the ontmd Topic URI field"
	  1.0.5.beta (20090317)
	  See MetadataGroupPanel, Option, MdUtil, MdHelper.
	  
	- Using style OBF to reduce size of javascript (issue #108: "ontmd client: 1.0MB per load")
	
	
2009-03-13
	- Fixed http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=98:
	                "new version allows the shortName and authority to be changed"
	                
		- See OntMdServiceImpl._checkUriKeyCombinationForNewVersion
		  Now, OntMd doesn't allow the shortName (resource type) or the organization
		  abbreviation to be changed when a *new version* submission is attempted.
		  
		  
	- Implemented http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=87:
					"Ability to have Voc2RDF handle quoted strings for table preview"
		- See VocabPanel.parseLine(), which is used now in updateTabularView().
		   Note: it only handles the double quote (") case.
		- This is Voc2RDF 2.0.0.beta5
		
	                
2009-03-12
	- Fixed http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=63:
	                Matching auth+topic not detected as potential update
		- Added ontologyId attribute to the OntologyInfo class, such that the "review"
		  operation has access to it, and thus proceed with the appropriate check in
		  case ontologyId == null (meaning the review is for a *new* submission, not a
		  new version).
		  See OntMdServiceImpl._checkNoPreexistingOntology
		- Note, the _checkNoPreexistingOntology check is repeated in the "upload" operation
		  in case there is a new registration done by other user in the meantime (from when the
		  "review" was done). Of course, we are NOT completely solving the potential concurrency 
		  problem with this re-check; we are just reducing the chances of that event.

2009-03-11
	- Added sample.build.properties to be used as a template for the actual build.properties
	  (which is now removed from the SVN repository), and so facilitate build and deployment.
	  In particular, I'm using this approach to set up logging to an ontmd.log file under
	  the servlet container's logs directory. This follows the same strategy as in the
	  "ont" project for ontology and term URI resolution.
	- Using commons logging in server classes. 

		  

2009-03-10

	- Investigating http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=63:
	                Matching auth+topic not detected as potential update
	
		-Created a base vocabulary:
	      http://mmisw.org/ont/mmitest/20090310T221213/parametro


	- Fixed http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=97: 
	    Left and right borders are not displayed in firefox 
	  The fix (well, workaround) was to remove ``table { empty-cells: hide; }'' in Main.css.
	  



2008-11-14   -   Voc2RDF 2.0.0.beta4

	Issue 27: URIs have # signs instead of / before terms

	- JenaUtil2. Converter, OntMdServiceImpl:
	  Re-setting fragment separator to / and doing necessary adjustments to start
	  using / in general.
	  
	oops: some URIs are coming with trailing # in the links in the metadata panel.
	For now, any trailing framegments are just removed before creating the links,
	see MetadataPanel.NewUri.setUri(String uri, boolean link).

	  ok: updated the issue with some instructions to verify the change.
	
	
	
	- weird behavior on my station: couldn't "load" a local file in the ontmd editor;
	  seemed like a cache issue with my browser.  (no problem now).
	  
	 
	- Voc2RDF: now transfers the sessionId/userId information from the given parameters
	  (eg, from ORR front-end) to the ontmd tool so the user won't have to log in again.
	  Fixes issue 30: http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=30
	  
	  
2008-11-12

	- Done Request 46: allow to manually specify version of submitted ontology (internal)

	- Done 41: add cdip namespace, and others.
	  Ok, ontmd is using the following text file as external resources to get the authorities
	  and the resources types:
		    authorities.csv
		    resourcetypes.csv
	  See Config.java
	   
	
	Voc2RDF (2.0.0.beta2)
	Re. 43: Handle non-UTF8 inputs 
	- Voc2RDF: New _convertToUtf8(String str) utility in Converter.
	  FIXME implementation is rather simplistic:
	     return new String(str.getBytes(), "UTF-8"))
	  A better approach is to determine the actual original charset and
	  then do the conversion to UTF-8.
	  
	  
2008-11-11 (1.0.0.beta)    (Happy B-day Ini!)

	- Declaring beta status!
	
	- Using new Voc2RDF logo created by Paul (thanks!).


2008-11-10 (1.0.0.alpha7)
	- Fixed 38: show the "owl" and "html" links
	  --> include hot links in the read-only view of a registered ontology
	
2008-11-09 (1.0.0.alpha7)

	- Voc2RDF functionality re-merged in this project.

	- New tooltip handling via an "?" icon.
	
	- JenaUtil2: with some of the methods in JenaUtil but with some adjustments.
	  Initially intended to handle the fragment separator, which is '#' always in
	  the original version. Currently, JenaUtil2 still uses '#' but already
	  factors out this element so it's easier to test for a different fragment
	  separator, especifically, '/'.
	  Preliminary tests, show that the Jena library handles the '/' separator
	  differently than with '#'. For example, elements in the base namaspace are
	  nicely identified with relative references when '#' is used, but not
	  with '/'.  This may be just a cosmetic difference but I haven't tested
	  this thoroughly yet (especially in terms of transferring elements from a
	  given ontology to the new to be uploaded in the repository).
	  
	- Improved handling of the "_map" suffix in the shortName.
	

2008-11-06 (0.1.alpha6)

	- OntologyPanel:  Since "load registry file" is not implemented directly,
	  I removed the related GUI elements (via a flag, so I can return to that later
	  if necessary). Note: the user would use the main front-end to choose a
	  registered ontology, and then ontmd will be called to proceed 
	  with the creation of the new version.
	
	- Passing call parameters to the initialization (getBaseInfo) to better logging
	  on the server side.
	  
	- Now handling aquaportal versions: a parameter "ontologyId", if given, will be
	  used to perform the final REST upload call, so the new version gets linked with
	  the same family of versions for the given ontology.
	
	- Added authority: mvco: Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory
	- Main and BaseInfo: better handling of possible error while getting BaseInfo.
	
	- Fixed link to HTML version after upload. (it uses "?form=html" mechanism).
	
	
2008-11-05
	- Fixed Issue 25: Visiting ontology=>new without logging in does not require login.
	  In general, the logic to handle initialization is much clear now. 
	  See MainPanel() constructor.
	  
	- various GUI improvements.
	
2008-11-04 (0.1.alpha5)
	- Message improvements
	- Better integration with voc2rdf
	
	- Everything working pretty nicely! :-)
	
	TODO: Unify replicated code with voc2rdf !!
	
	
	
2008-11-03 (0.1.alpha4)

	- Assign omv:creationDate with format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ
	
	- Fixed the following: repeated attributes will come out in the resulting ontology
	(eg, multiple omv:uri entries) when the original resource already contains those
	attributes. Now, any pre-exisiting attributes that are given new values are
	not tranferred from the original source, of course.
	
	- shortName attribute handled as a special case (time contrains force to take
	  quick, not-so-elegant solutions :( 
	
	- upload: setting file extension to .owl per aquaportal requirement
	
	- hot link to uploaded ontology upon succesful submission.
	
	
2008-11-02

	- Fixed Issue 10: load a registered ontology
		- This is now completed for the case when the URI is passed as a parameter
		  ontologyUri=uuuu along with the new parameter "_edit" which should be
		  set to "_edit=y" to allow the edition of a new version of the ontology.
		  
		  (Note: the button to "load a registered ontology" is not yet implemented
		  and perhaps it shouldn't at least initially, the reasons being:
		  	- Main entry point to create a new version is the Aquaportal front-end;
		  	- This way, the user is already logged-in and in fact she can only launch
		  	  the edition of her own ontologies, so this control is already in place.
		  	  
	- Username is not shown if ontmd is launched with the userId and sessionId params.
			
		
	- some code clean-up:
		-MdHelper: removed unused stuff (AttributeValue class, title).
		
	- Fixed Issue 11: Assign DC from the Omv and OmvMmi props -- and vice versa!
	  This happens at two moments:
	  	- When an ontology is loaded: Existing DC attributes are used to fill in
	  	  missing MMI attributes.
	  	- When the "review" process is executed: Existing MMI attributes are used 
	  	  to fill in missing DC attributes.
	  Equivalences were defined in MdHelper.
	  
	- Improved error checking and diagnostics upon initial loading of an ontology. 
		
2008-11-01
	- MetadataPanel doesn't show the original base URI anymore; this info is already
	  provided in the Ontology panel.
	  
	- Fixed 18: "namespace not updated". Main changes in OntMdServiceImpl:
	  - _replaceNameSpace(OntModel model, String oldNameSpace, String newNameSpace)
	    updates all statements having any element in the original namespace to be in the
	    new namespace.
	  - the pre-existing owl:Ontology, if any, is replaced with a new one that will have
	    the appropriate URI.
	  

	- Improved login interface.
	
2008-10-31
	- Fixed 17: example still data included.
	  The general behavior was that resetting to original values was incorrect.
	  Now, an OntologyInfo object two maps, one for the original values, and the
	  other for new values (assignied during the editing session, either manually
	  or by running the "example" actions).

	- several improvements.

2008-10-30
	- UploadServlet: use File.createTempFile with sessionId; the previous scheme
	  was buggy!
	- Fixed: 15: preview operation not idempotent
	- Also fixed: multiple owl:Ontology sections: now the esiting one is used
	  to add/updated the metadata attributes.
	  
	- ontologyUri= parameter: it is handled by just displaying the metadataPanel
	  in no-editing mode:
	  	- no buttons
	  	- no required marks (*)
	  	- no listBoxes, just plain textboxes
	  this functionality can be used in:
	  	- the aquaportal front-end (already called from there)
	  	- HTML output in the Ont URI resolver (TODO)


2008-10-29 
	- submit new ontology starting from local file:
		basic steps implemented: load-edit-review-upload

TODOS:
	- load a registered ontology
	- Assign DC from the Omv and OmvMmi props
	
2008-10-28 (started; based on voc2rdf)

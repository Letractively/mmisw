	Module extracted from vine prototype. The goal is to unify the various operations to the
	server throwugh this module.
	Note: this module provides the serializable objects required for the communication and
	a set of core types to be used on the server side.
	
	This is initially to be used by OntMd to provide the "portal" interface. Later,
	vine itself will be integrated.

org.mmisw.iserver - ORR Client Library ("interface to the server")
Carlos Rueda  -  http://marinemetadata.org

- Rename this module to org.mmisw.client. 

- adjust directory structure to a more standard (non-GWT and non-webapp) layout, eg. 
  package org.mmisw.iserver.gwt.client.rpc --> org.mmisw.iserver.model 
  ./base_war/WEB_INF/lib/ --> ./lib/
  See ChangeLog 2010-08-20
  
- Mavenize (but look at Buildr as well, perhaps getting the best from both).

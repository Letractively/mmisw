The direction from which it is coming must be specified, for instance with a coordinate of zenith_angle. If the radiation does not depend on direction, a standard name of isotropic radiance should be chosen instead. "Photosynthetic" radiation is the part of the spectrum which is used in photosynthesis e.g. 300-700 nm.

There must be a vertical coordinate variable indicating the extent of the layer(s). If the layers are model layers, the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is recommended to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as well. The optical thickness is the integral along the path of radiation of a volume scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient. The radiative flux is reduced by a factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path. A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can be specified to indicate that the optical thickness applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies. "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). "Ambient aerosol" is aerosol that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol.

      <Standard_Name rdf:about="sea_surface_foundation_temperature">
        <rdfs:comment>The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The sea surface foundation temperature is the water temperature that is not influenced by a thermally stratified layer of diurnal temperature variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). The foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is the temperature from which the growth of the diurnal thermocline develops each day, noting that on some occasions with a deep mixed layer there is no clear foundation temperature in the surface layer. In general, sea surface foundation temperature will be similar to a night time minimum or pre-dawn value at depths of between approximately 1 and 5 meters. In the absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is considered equivalent to the quantity with standard name sea_surface_subskin_temperature. The sea surface foundation temperature defines a level in the upper water column that varies in depth, space, and time depending on the local balance between thermal stratification and turbulent energy and is expected to change slowly over the course of a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard name sea_surface_foundation_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical coordinate variable to specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea surface foundation temperature is measured at the base of the diurnal thermocline or as close to the water surface as possible in the absence of thermal stratification. Only in situ contact thermometry is able to measure the sea surface foundation temperature. Analysis procedures must be used to estimate sea surface foundation temperature value from radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities with standard names sea_surface_skin_temperature and sea_surface_subskin_temperature. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a connection with the historical concept of a "bulk" sea surface temperature considered representative of the oceanic mixed layer temperature that is typically represented by any sea temperature measurement within the upper ocean over a depth range of 1 to approximately 20 meters. The general term, "bulk" sea surface temperature, has the standard name sea_surface_temperature with no associated vertical coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a more precise, well-defined quantity than "bulk" sea surface temperature and, consequently, is more representative of the mixed layer temperature. The temperature of sea water at a particular depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the standard name sea_water_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a vertical coordinate axis or scalar coordinate variable.</rdfs:comment>

A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Sublimation is the conversion of solid into vapor. Deposition is the opposite of sublimation, i.e. it is the conversion of vapor into solid. Deposition is distinct from the processes of dry deposition and wet deposition of atmospheric aerosol particles, which are referred to in some standard names. In an atmosphere model, stratiform cloud is that produced by large-scale convergence (not the convection schemes).

"Displacement" means the change in geospatial position of an object that has moved over time. If possible, the time interval over which the motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable. A displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the displacement variable. A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component. An eastward displacement is the distance calculated from the change in a moving object's longitude between the start and end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The optical thickness is the integral along the path of radiation of a volume scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient. The radiative flux is reduced by a factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path. The atmosphere optical thickness applies to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere. "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). "Ambient aerosol" is aerosol that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. "Pm10 aerosol" is an air pollutant with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers.</rdfs:comment>

"Inorganic bromine", sometimes referred to as Bry, describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of source gases containing bromine (halons, methyl bromide, VSLS) and natural inorganic bromine sources such as volcanoes, seasalt and other aerosols. "Inorganic bromine" is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. Standard names that use the term "brox" are used for quantities that contain all inorganic bromine species except HBr and BrONO2.</rdfs:comment>

The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. In ocean modelling, diazotrophs are phytoplankton of the phylum cyanobacteria distinct from other phytoplankton groups in their ability to fix nitrogen gas in addition to nitrate and ammonium.

        <rdfs:comment>The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The optical thickness is the integral along the path of radiation of a volume scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient. The radiative flux is reduced by a factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path. The atmosphere optical thickness applies to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere. "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). "Ambient aerosol" is aerosol that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. Black carbon aerosol is composed of elemental carbon. It is strongly light absorbing.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The construction "atmosphere_moles_of_X" means the total number of moles of X in the entire atmosphere, i.e. summed over the atmospheric column and over the entire globe. "Brox" describes a family of chemical species consisting of inorganic bromine compounds with the exception of hydrogen bromide (HBr) and bromine nitrate (BrONO2). "Brox" is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. "Inorganic bromine", sometimes referred to as Bry, describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of source gases containing bromine (halons, methyl bromide, VSLS) and natural inorganic bromine sources such as volcanoes, seasalt and other aerosols. Standard names that use the term "inorganic_bromine" are used for quantities that contain all inorganic bromine species including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean "net downward". Radiative flux is the sum of shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes. When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called "irradiance". In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called "vector irradiance". In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics. The volume scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient is the fractional change of radiative flux per unit path length due to the stated process. Coefficients with canonical units of m2 s-1 i.e. multiplied by density have standard names with specific_ instead of volume_. The scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient is assumed to be an integral over all wavelengths, unless a coordinate of radiation_wavelength is included to specify the wavelength. Attenuation is the sum of absorption and scattering. Attenuation is sometimes called "extinction". Also called "diffuse" attenuation, the attenuation of downwelling radiative flux refers to the decrease with decreasing height or increasing depth of the downwelling component of radiative flux, regardless of incident direction.</rdfs:comment>

The radiative flux is reduced by a factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path. The atmosphere optical thickness applies to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere. "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). "Ambient aerosol" is aerosol that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. "Pm1 aerosol" is an air pollutant with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 1 micrometer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The construction "atmosphere_moles_of_X" means the total number of moles of X in the entire atmosphere, i.e. summed over the atmospheric column and over the entire globe. "Clox" describes a family of chemical species consisting of inorganic chlorine compounds with the exception of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). "Clox" is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. "Inorganic chlorine", sometimes referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other aerosols. Standard names that use the term "inorganic_chlorine" are used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>"Equivalent reflectivity factor" is the radar reflectivity factor that is calculated from the measured radar return power assuming the target is composed of liquid water droplets whose diameter is less than one tenth of the radar wavelength, i.e., treating the droplets as Rayleigh scatterers. The actual radar reflectivity factor would depend on the size distribution and composition of the particles within the target volume and these are often unknown.

"Noy" describes a family of chemical species. The family usually includes atomic nitrogen (N), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitric acid (HNO3), peroxynitric acid (HNO4), bromine nitrate (BrONO2) , chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) and organic nitrates (most notably peroxyacetyl nitrate, sometimes referred to as PAN, (CH3COO2NO2)). The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A.

The direction from which it is coming must be specified, for instance with a coordinate of zenith_angle. If the radiation does not depend on direction, a standard name of isotropic radiance should be chosen instead. A photon flux is specified in terms of numbers of photons expressed in moles.</rdfs:comment>

The optical thickness is the integral along the path of radiation of a volume scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient. The radiative flux is reduced by a factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path. The atmosphere optical thickness applies to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere. "Aerosol" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). "Ambient aerosol" is aerosol that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol.

A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A.

The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. "Net primary production" is the excess of gross primary production of organic carbon (the rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs ("producers"), for example, photosynthesis in phytoplankton, over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. In ocean modelling, diazotrophs are phytoplankton of the phylum cyanobacteria distinct from other phytoplankton groups in their ability to fix nitrogen gas in addition to nitrate and ammonium. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis.

	- Completed download from CF website and conversion, with outputs written to a given
	  workspace directory (by default workspace/cf/).
	  Outputs are generated if the downloaded contents correspond a new version_number 
	  (or if --force is indicated). A workspace directory (--ws <dir>) is the only required parameter.
	   
	  The usage message is:
	  
		USAGE: org.mmisw.watchdog.Cf --ws <directory> [options]
		  options:
		    --input <url>         (http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/standard-name-table/current/cf-standard-name-table.xml)
		    --ns <uri>            (http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/cf/parameter/)
		    --output <filename>   (${workspace}/${basename}-${version_number}.owl)
		    --force               (false)
		    --impl [jena|skosapi] (skosapi)

	- Changes to allow multiple implementations, in particular to start testing the
	  SKOS API library), and enabling arguments to the program.
	  
	- Argh, I spent quite some time trying to make Eclipse to resolve the maven dependency 'skosapi':
	  it shows as a directory under "Maven Dependencies" instead of the jar.  
	  Then I noticed that it works well if running mvn from the command-line.
	  So, I'm *manually* adding the skosapi JAR in the build path for Eclipse at least to be able
	  to continue using the IDE with the compile facilities.

	- Preparing to use SKOS API libraries, which are now deployed in Sonatype repository.
	
	-  Following instructions at 
	    https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide
	  especially re. snapshot publication (stating and release not a concern for the moment).
	  
	  - created ~/.m2/settings.xml with this contents:
			<settings>
			  <servers>
			    <server>
			      <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
			      <username>carueda</username>
			      <password>MY JIRA PASSWORD</password>
			    </server>
			    <server>
			      <id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
			      <username>carueda</username>
			      <password>MY JIRA PASSWORD</password>
			    </server>
			  </servers>
			</settings>
	  - added the following to pom.xml:
			  <parent>
			    <groupId>org.sonatype.oss</groupId>
			    <artifactId>oss-parent</artifactId>
			    <version>3</version>
			  </parent>
	  - deploy snapshot:
	  		mvn clean deploy
	  		
	  and the snapshot is published:
	    https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mmisw/watchdog/

	  
2010-07-12

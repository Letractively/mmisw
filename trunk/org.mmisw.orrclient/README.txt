org.mmisw.iserver - ORR Client Library ("interface to the server")
Carlos Rueda  -  http://marinemetadata.org
May 2009

This module provides a library for clients to interact with the registry server
(this module should probably be called org.mmisw.client)

Goals:
	More flexible design
	Core functionality separated from UI concerns

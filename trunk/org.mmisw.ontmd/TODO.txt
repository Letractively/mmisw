org.mmisw.ontmd Ontology Metadata Manager
Carlos Rueda - MMI / MBARI

(p: Paul;  j: John;  c: carlos)


c: Get the original ns when model.getNsPrefixURI("") returns null			
This case was manifested with the platform.owl ontology.


j: The ontology in Ontology tab should be clearly identified as the original
ontology. Then there should be a window (maybe under that one?) that shows the
uploaded ontology. So the two can be inspected together.


p: The Show view with the iframe is clocking in at 1.5MB per load. The front-end
already runs about 500KB, and ontmd looks like it's ~1000KB. It's kind of slow
for me on my connection from home. Takes ~15 secs to load the whole view.

p: Could the Review pop-up window have an upload button if the review passes?

p: It looks like the boxes are missing the outsides on Firefox.




j: We'll need an undo for that (Example, Reset)  someday. Not now.

(p: Paul;  j: John;  c: carlos)


c: Get the original ns when model.getNsPrefixURI("") returns null			
This case was manifested with the platform.owl ontology.


j: The ontology in Ontology tab should be clearly identified as the original
ontology. Then there should be a window (maybe under that one?) that shows the
uploaded ontology. So the two can be inspected together.


p: Could the Review pop-up window have an upload button if the review passes?



j: We'll need an undo for that (Example, Reset)  someday. Not now.

ChangeLog

2008-11-03 (0.1.alpha4)

	- Assign omv:creationDate with format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ
	
	- Fixed the following: repeated attributes will come out in the resulting ontology
	(eg, multiple omv:uri entries) when the original resource already contains those
	attributes. Now, any pre-exisiting attributes that are given new values are
	not tranferred from the original source, of course.
	
	- shortName attribute handled as a special case (time contrains force to take
	  quick, not-so-elegant solutions :( 
	
	- upload: setting file extension to .owl per aquaportal requirement
	
	- hot link to uploaded ontology upon succesful submission.

	- Fixed Issue 10: load a registered ontology
		- This is now completed for the case when the URI is passed as a parameter
		  ontologyUri=uuuu along with the new parameter "_edit" which should be
		  set to "_edit=y" to allow the edition of a new version of the ontology.
		  
		  (Note: the button to "load a registered ontology" is not yet implemented
		  and perhaps it shouldn't at least initially, the reasons being:
		  	- Main entry point to create a new version is the Aquaportal front-end;
		  	- This way, the user is already logged-in and in fact she can only launch
		  	  the edition of her own ontologies, so this control is already in place.
		  	  
	- Username is not shown if ontmd is launched with the userId and sessionId params.
			
		
	- some code clean-up:
		-MdHelper: removed unused stuff (AttributeValue class, title).
		
	- Fixed Issue 11: Assign DC from the Omv and OmvMmi props -- and vice versa!
	  This happens at two moments:
	  	- When an ontology is loaded: Existing DC attributes are used to fill in
	  	  missing MMI attributes.
	  	- When the "review" process is executed: Existing MMI attributes are used 
	  	  to fill in missing DC attributes.
	  Equivalences were defined in MdHelper.
	  
	- Improved error checking and diagnostics upon initial loading of an ontology. 
		
2008-11-01
	- MetadataPanel doesn't show the original base URI anymore; this info is already
	  provided in the Ontology panel.
	  
	- Fixed 18: "namespace not updated". Main changes in OntMdServiceImpl:
	  - _replaceNameSpace(OntModel model, String oldNameSpace, String newNameSpace)
	    updates all statements having any element in the original namespace to be in the
	    new namespace.
	  - the pre-existing owl:Ontology, if any, is replaced with a new one that will have
	    the appropriate URI.
	  

	- Improved login interface.
	
2008-10-31
	- Fixed 17: example still data included.
	  The general behavior was that resetting to original values was incorrect.
	  Now, an OntologyInfo object two maps, one for the original values, and the
	  other for new values (assignied during the editing session, either manually
	  or by running the "example" actions).

	- several improvements.

2008-10-30
	- UploadServlet: use File.createTempFile with sessionId; the previous scheme
	  was buggy!
	- Fixed: 15: preview operation not idempotent
	- Also fixed: multiple owl:Ontology sections: now the esiting one is used
	  to add/updated the metadata attributes.
	  
	- ontologyUri= parameter: it is handled by just displaying the metadataPanel
	  in no-editing mode:
	  	- no buttons
	  	- no required marks (*)
	  	- no listBoxes, just plain textboxes
	  this functionality can be used in:
	  	- the aquaportal front-end (already called from there)
	  	- HTML output in the Ont URI resolver (TODO)


2008-10-29 
	- submit new ontology starting from local file:
		basic steps implemented: load-edit-review-upload

TODOS:
	- load a registered ontology
	- Assign DC from the Omv and OmvMmi props
	
2008-10-28 (started; based on voc2rdf)

Carlos Rueda - MMI / MBARI

ChangeLog

2008-11-01
	- Fixed 18: "namespace not updated". Main changes in OntMdServiceImpl:
	  - _replaceNameSpace(OntModel model, String oldNameSpace, String newNameSpace)
	    updates all statements having any element in the original namespace to be in the
	    new namespace.
	  - the pre-existing owl:Ontology, if any, is replaced with a new one that will have
	    the appropriate URI.
	  

	- Improved login interface.

	- Fixed 17: example still data included.
	  The general behavior was that resetting to original values was incorrect.
	  Now, an OntologyInfo object two maps, one for the original values, and the
	  other for new values (assignied during the editing session, either manually
	  or by running the "example" actions).

	- several improvements.

2008-10-30
	- UploadServlet: use File.createTempFile with sessionId; the previous scheme
	  was buggy!
	- Fixed: 15: preview operation not idempotent
	- Also fixed: multiple owl:Ontology sections: now the esiting one is used
	  to add/updated the metadata attributes.
	  
	- ontologyUri= parameter: it is handled by just displaying the metadataPanel
	  in no-editing mode:
	  	- no buttons
	  	- no required marks (*)
	  	- no listBoxes, just plain textboxes
	  this functionality can be used in:
	  	- the aquaportal front-end (already called from there)
	  	- HTML output in the Ont URI resolver (TODO)


2008-10-29

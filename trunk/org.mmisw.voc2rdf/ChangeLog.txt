org.mmisw.voc2rdf II 
Carlos Rueda - MMI / MBARI

ChangeLog

	- Because of problems to use the java sources in:
	  http://mmi.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mmi/org.mmi.ont.voc2owl/src/org/mmi/ont/voc2owl/trans/
	  I asked Luis to make sure the repository is up to date... well, there were uncommitted changes!
	  Ok, now it works, so I'm removing the dependency on the org.mmi.ont.voc2owl.trans.jar library,
	  and continuing using the new package org.mmisw.voc2rdf.transf as indicated yesterday.
	  Now, will continue with clean-up and preparation to support metadata
	  attributes in a more flexible way (current library only uses a set of the DC properties).

	- Starting changes for enhanced metadata handling in the conversion:
		- new Converter which is a simplified adaptation of 
		  org.mmi.ont.MetadataBean (which was removed).
		  
		- also, new package org.mmisw.voc2rdf.transf with elements from Luis'
		  org.mmi.ont.voc2owl.trans package:
		      http://mmi.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mmi/org.mmi.ont.voc2owl/src/org/mmi/ont/voc2owl/trans/
		  as a convenient way to start doing the changes in the core conversion utility.
		  
		  Note: there are still references to elements in org.mmi.ont.voc2owl.trans, but those
		  will be removed as the code is refactored. 
		  
		  Note: 
		  The org.mmisw.voc2rdf.transf package currently kept here as part of the Voc2RDF web application, 
		  but will eventually be moved to an independent library API so it's easier to reuse (TODO).

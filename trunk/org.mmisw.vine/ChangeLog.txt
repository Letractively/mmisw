org.mmisw.vine Vocabulary INtegration Environment II
Carlos Rueda - MMI / MBARI

ChangeLog

2008-12-29
	- List of vocabularies now obtained from the registry (via the Ont service).
	- User can now select the working vocabularies.  Prefixes A, B, etc. are
	  incrementally assigned to the working ontologies. Note that 2 or more
	  vocabularies can be specified.
	- Toggle buttons (identified with those prefixes) are to be used in the 
	  search section of each side.
	  
	Next:
		- start populating the "term" sections according to the selected vocabs
		  on each side and the search string.

	- Included GWT code from a preliminary exercise to emulate standalone GUI.
	  I will use this as a basis to define the core functionality.
	- Current set of relations is fixed but of course the new design should
	  allow a more flexible mechanism to specify the relations and associated
	  information (icons, rules, tooltips, etc).
	  
	- First section: selection of working ontologies, identified by A, B, ...
	  Then, in search section, user can select which ontologies to be searched
	  in each side of the mapping editor.

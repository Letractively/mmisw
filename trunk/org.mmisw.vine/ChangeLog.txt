ChangeLog

2008-12-02
	- Included GWT code from a preliminary exercise to emulate standalone GUI.
	  I will use this as a basis to define the core functionality.
	- Current set of relations is fixed but of course the new design should
	  allow a more flexible mechanism to specify the relations and associated
	  information (icons, rules, tooltips, etc).
	  
	- First section: selection of working ontologies, identified by A, B, ...
	  Then, in search section, user can select which ontologies to be searched
	  in each side of the mapping editor.

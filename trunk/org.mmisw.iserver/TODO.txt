org.mmisw.iserver 
Carlos Rueda  -  http://marinemetadata.org

Rename this module to org.mmisw.client and make it more generically usable (perhaps not necessarily
for GWT-enabled applications). 

Some TODOs as this module does not define any servlet:
- remove servlet-related stuff: base_war, WEB_INF, web.xml, etc. 
- Just keep a library directory and update build.xml accordingly.

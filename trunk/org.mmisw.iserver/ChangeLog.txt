	- several adjustments as the main operations are completed
	- removed several interim dependencies
	- some renamings of types and operations
	- support for registering an uploaded file completed

2009-06-04
	- Implemented the "loading" of local file into working space. This is capture in a TempOntologyInfo.
	  (note the uploading operation is still implemented in the ontmd module).
	- Other preparations for registration of an "other" ontology (not vine, nor voc2rdf).
	
	
2009-06-03
	- Instead of using CreateOntologyInfo as a base class for the various types of ontologies to be
	  created (currently only "vocabulary", but later "mapping" and "regular externally given ontology"),
	  it now contains a DataCreationInfo member. This DataCreationInfo will serve as the basis for extension
	  fot the various types of ontologies.
	  
	- fixed issue #140: "ontologies with no declared namespace for empty prefix are not accepted"
	  If default namespace is not defined, try using xml:base's URI. TODO: test!
	  
	  
2009-06-02
	- getAllOntologies(boolean includePriorVersions) and getOntologyInfo(String ontologyUri) complemented
	  with auxiliary Map<String, List<OntologyInfo>> getUnversionedToOntologyInfoListMap(String onlyThisUnversionedUri).
	- In particular,
		- getOntologyInfo(String ontologyUri) now handles versioned and unversioned URI requests.
		- getAllOntologies(boolean includePriorVersions): main entries in the returned list at UNversioned;
		  the sublist of priorVersions are in versioned form *including* the most recent.
		  Elements in the priorVersion list are sorted by descending dataCreated so the most recent is first.
	
2009-06-01
	- Added OntologyInfo getOntologyInfo(String ontologyUri).
	
2009-05-31
	- Util.getEntities(OntologyInfo ontologyInfo, OntModel ontModel): assign ClassInfo object 
	  corresponding to the domain of each property so it's easier to get associated attributes. 
	  
	- Many changes for including editing and creation of new version of a vocabulary ontology
	
2009-05-25
	- Support to handle different types of ontology data: vocabulary, mapping, and other, although
	  this is based on some heuristics; a better mechanism should be implemented (idea is to use
	  a particular ontology metadata property that indicates the type of ontology, for example
	  omv:usedOntologyEngineeringTool.
	
	
2009-05-24
	- getAllOntologies now return only the latest versions of all ontologies as the main entries
	  of the list; and, optionally, the prior versiones will be included in the internal property
	  priorVersions.
	  
	  
2009-05-23
	- included most of metadata management here (from ontmd module)

2009-05-22
	- Added username attribute to OntologyInfo
	
	- Added service getEntities(String ontologyUri), which btw facilitates current refactoring. 
	 
2009-05-13
	Module extracted from vine prototype. The goal is to unify the various operations to the
	server through this module.
	Note: this module provides the serializable objects required for the communication and
	a set of core types to be used on the server side.
	
	This is initially to be used by OntMd to provide the "portal" interface. Later,
	vine itself will be integrated.

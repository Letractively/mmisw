ChangeLog

2009-04-20
	- automatically open row disclosure in search results when only one result.
	

2009-04-17
	- Show associated properties and values for entities in the Search result form. 
	- Besides individuals, search now also includes owl:classes, rdf:properties,
	  owl:DatatypeProperty's, and owl:ObjectProperty's with the
	  search string also applied on the values of any associated properties of those entities.
	
2009-04-06  1.5.0.alpha1
	- Added some (?) tooltips and some "not implemented" actions to proceed with asking
	  for feedback especially regarding UI.
	  
	  Here are some the next steps regarding the core functionality:
	  	- Determine the mapping ontology to use as a basis for all mappings
	  	- Determine the mechanism to allow the creation or configuration of the set of relations
	  	  that can be used in a session.
	  	- Allow registration in the repository. Perhaps this will be similar to voc2rdf, so
	  	  some metadata should be captured.
	  	- Allow read-only display for browsing existing mapping ontologies.
	  	- Allow loading of a local mapping file?
	  	- Allow saving of the current mappings in a local file?
	  	 

2009-04-03  1.5.0.alpha
	- setting up build environment similar to that in org.mmisw.ontmd project:
		version.properties
		AppInfo
		Config
		log4j.xml
	- More layout improvements: using disclosure panels for displaying term info; some 
	  preliminary tests for doing a similar handling in the mappings panel, but this is
	  trickier because it'd be good to keep the alignment of the relation symbols.

2009-04-02 
	- New MappingsPanel with a tabular of the current mappings.
	- Started handling of created mappings (RelationInfo)
	
2009-04-01
	- Resuming with some updates and preparing to show info about select term in the
	  search result panel, and created mappings..
	  
	  
2009-01-06
	- Added new logo.
	- Using SuggestBox to select a vocabulary into the working list.
	- Improved dialog dispatch for selecting and loading a vocabulary into the working list.
	- OntologyInfo: transient code to identify the vocab only on the client side
	- Search now done on selected vocabs; also the loading.gif image is shown as a progress
	  notification while searching.
	- Search: Using List<EntityInfo> as preparation for showing associated information for
	  found entities.
	  TODO: allow selection of entities to show the info.
	
2008-12-31
	- Various additions
	
	
2008-12-30
	- Started populating the "term" sections according to the selected vocabs
	  on each side and the search string. There is a preliminary core.Util class
	  with some Jena-based stuff to obtain information about a selected ontology.
	- Search operation is now performed on the client side: required info about
	  each selected (working) ontology is obtained from the server and stored in
	  the corresponding OntologyInfo object.
	
2008-12-29
	- List of vocabularies now obtained from the registry (via the Ont service).
	- User can now select the working vocabularies.  Prefixes A, B, etc. are
	  incrementally assigned to the working ontologies. Note that 2 or more
	  vocabularies can be specified.
	- Toggle buttons (identified with those prefixes) are to be used in the 
	  search section of each side.
	  
		
2008-12-02
	- Included GWT code from a preliminary exercise to emulate standalone GUI.
	  I will use this as a basis to define the core functionality.
	- Current set of relations is fixed but of course the new design should
	  allow a more flexible mechanism to specify the relations and associated
	  information (icons, rules, tooltips, etc).
	  
	- First section: selection of working ontologies, identified by A, B, ...
	  Then, in search section, user can select which ontologies to be searched
	  in each side of the mapping editor.
	
	
2008-11-26  
	- (Very) preliminary set-up of this project

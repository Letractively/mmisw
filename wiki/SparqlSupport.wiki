#summary Comments about the support for SPARQL queries in the Ont service
#labels org.mmisw.ont

I'm currently using the Ont service to test the enabling of SPARQL queries against the ontologies in our aquaportal back-end. This is an implementation convenience as this support should probably be offered via other service.

== current status ==

To run a SPARQL query, use the `sparql` parameter:
   ["CONSTRUCT  { ?s ?p ?o } where{?s ?p ?o. } LIMIT 20" http://mmisw.org/ont?sparql=CONSTRUCT  { ?s ?p ?o } where{?s ?p ?o. } LIMIT 20]

For convenience, this same query is performed if no argument is provided:
    http://mmisw.org/ont?sparql


== stylesheet ==

An XSLT stylesheet can be used to process a SPARQL response. Currently only the stylesheet provided by Luis is available. To use this option, add the `xslt` parameter:
    http://mmisw.org/ont?sparql&xslt

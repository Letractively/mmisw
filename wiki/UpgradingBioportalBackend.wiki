= Aspects to consider for upgrading to a newer version of BioPortal back-end =


Currently using bioportal-1006


== Registering a new version of an ontology ==

if the user logged in is an administrator, then we use the user ID of the existing ontology instead of the administrator's ID. 
This is possible because the back-end does not check that the session has to be used in combination with the logged in user. So, the overall mechanism should be revisited later, especially if we upgrade.

#summary Mechanism to support and resolve URNs

= Registering a vocabulary with URN terms =

In the context of the [http://mmisw.org/ontmd/voc2rdf/ Voc2RDF] tool, the current mechanism is basically as follows. (Note: the MMI tools are in general undergoing significant changes at time of writing.)

== Basic Voc2RDF functionality ==

Basically, Voc2RDF takes a base URI and a list of terms and creates a corresponding file on RDF format. Example:

Vocabulary URI: http://mmisw.org/ont/myvocab
|| name || description ||
|| foo  || foo description ... ||
|| baz  || baz description ... ||

The first row is a header specifying properties for the terms in the subsequent rows. First column is special in that it is used to create the URI for the term in each row. In the example above, the final URI for the "foo" term will be "http://mmisw.org/ont/myvocab/foo". This term URI will be *directly* resolvable. For the remainder of this note, "MMISW-based URI" will refer to URIs at the MMI Registry that are directly resolvable in this sense. 

== User-specified term URIs ==

However, if the header label of the first column in the Voc2RDF term table is "URI", then the values in the column will be used as given, ie., no composition with the base URI will be performed. For example:

Vocabulary URI: http://mmisw.org/ont/myvocab2
|| URI || description ||
|| http://mydomain.xyz/abcd/foo  || foo description ... ||
|| http://other.xyz/baz          || baz description ... ||

== User-specified term URNs ==

Of course, the user-scpecified URIs can in particular be URNs, for example:

|| URI || description ||
|| urn:ogc:def:crs:ogc:1_3:crs27  || NAD27 longitude-latitude B.5 in OGC 06-042 ||


= Resolving URIs =

As noted above, any MMISW-based URI is resolvable directly. For those URIs that were explicitly specified by the user, the following HTTP request is supported:
    http://mmisw.org/ont?uri=<a URI>
for example:
    http://mmisw.org/ont?uri=urn:ogc:def:crs:ogc:1_3:crs27

= Re-hosting ontologies =

"Re-hosting" means that the original URI and the contents of the ontology are kept intact in the registered entry (except for metadata attributes). 

*NOTE*: The external URI is completely *opaque*. In particular, for the purposes of versioning, the "?version=xxx" parameter is the only mechanism in the "Ont" service (see below) to resolve particular versions of a re-hosted ontology. By default, the most recent version of the ontology is retrieved.


== Ont URI Resolution service ==

Requests to resolve a re-hosted ontology against the registry need to use the "uri" parameter:

   `http://mmisw.org/ont?uri=<uri>`

This returns the most recent version of the corresponding ontology. To retrieve a particular version, use the "version" parameter:

   `http://mmisw.org/ont?uri=<uri>&version=<version>`

As usual, the format of the response is determined by content-negotiation. Use the "form" parameter to request a particular format, eg., N3:

   `http://mmisw.org/ont?uri=<uri>&version=<version>&form=n3`

As usual, when the determined output format is HTML, the Ont service redirects the request to the portal service for enhanced navigation capabilities.

#summary URI dereferencing as proposed by MMI

(_from John's email on Oct 15/08_)

We propose the enclosed URI interpretations and responses. All the URIs are assumed to begin 'http://mmisw.org/ont/{auth}/'. (They may have an optional '{version}/'; 'auth' is the ontology authority. More details on the URL construction are at http://mmisw.org/apguides/ontprovidersguide/ontguideconstructinguris.)

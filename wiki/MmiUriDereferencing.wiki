= Status of current implementation =

Preliminary preparations in place.

Here are some examples using http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter.owl

||http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter.owl ||->|| original ontology||
||http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter || ->|| original ontology. If the direct URI is not found, Ont will try with "owl" appended.||

For the following, `xxxx?info` returns some general information about the requested URI: parsing, database search results, location of file on disk.  (this is for internal testing.)

||http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter?info ||->|| general info including all the subjects in the ontology. Ont replaces any "#" in the subjects with a "/", so it can be resolved directly. The info link is the same subject URI with the `?info` appended.||
||http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter/northward_ocean_heat_transport_due_to_bolus_advection?info ||->|| info for the particular subject (term)||
||http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter/northward_ocean_heat_transport_due_to_bolus_advection ||->|| just a placeholder for now (pretty much the same as the ?info one.||
